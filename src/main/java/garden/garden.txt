1. Write the following classes:
a) A Plant abstract class with the field: oxygenProduction (mandatory for an object)
b) A Fructiferous interface with the field: color and a method getTimeToHarvest
c) An Orange class that extends Plant and Fructiferous with the fields: age, height
d) A Pinidae class that extends Plant with a public field numberOfSpecies equal to 50, with the method getGrowthEnvironment that returns mountain
e) A Cedar class that extends Pinidae with an overridden field numberOfSpecies equal to 10 and a method getGrowthEnvironment that return mountain and Mediterranean
f) An Eatable interface that will be extended by both Orange and Cedar class with a method isEatable
g) Create an object: An orange tree, aged 10, of height 5, that is eatable, the time to harvest is August and an oxygen production of 50
h) Create an object: A Cedar tree having a reference type of Pinidae, with an oxygen production of 200, not eatable. Print the field number of species and the result of the getGrowthEnvironment method.
i) Implement a way to create a Rose object
